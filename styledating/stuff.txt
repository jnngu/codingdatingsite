possible language-agnostic metrics:
  lines of code
  usage of camelCase vs snake_case vs UpperCase (need to know what all keywords are)
  tabs vs spaces
  average line length
  maximum line length
  number of functions defined (need to know what a function keyword is)
  number of comments (need to know what comment delimiters are)

possible language-specific metrics:
  curly braces with a space or newline or not (C)
  fors vs whiles vs gotos vs do-whiles (C)
